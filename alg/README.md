# Learning centric power allocation scheme 

### Majorization minimization for interference aware settings

The algorithm is in folder "mm". It is based on finding surrogate functions iteratively.

### Closed-form solution for interference free (massive MIMO) settings

The algorithm is in folder "cf". It is based on the optimality conditions.
